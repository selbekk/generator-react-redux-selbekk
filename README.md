# An opinionated react / redux boilerplate generator

This generator helps you set up a basic react application with a router and
redux and all the things.

If you don't like it, that's cool. It's just for me.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-react-redux-selbekk
$ yo react-redux-selbekk
```

Boom :bomb:
